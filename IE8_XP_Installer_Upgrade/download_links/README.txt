This directory contains lists of direct downloads links of Internet Explorer 8
and their updates for Windows XP or Server 2003 of all available languages.

These links should continue to work as long as Microsoft keep hosting the files
(even though their download pages are redesigned and no longer compatible with
IE6, the default browser shipped with vanilla XP/2003).

Obsolete updates (updates that are replaced by another update published in a
newer security bulletin / KB article) are not included here. Most users don't
need them anyway.
